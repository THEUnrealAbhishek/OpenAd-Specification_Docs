# OpenAd Specification

## Documentation / Adblockers

**For adblockers**

The OpenAd specification acknowledges that not everyone wants to see ads, and that a sizeable portion of global Internet users use an ad blocker. Compliant ads within this specification will make no effort to try and prevent themselves from getting blocked.

Blocking OpenAd specification-compliant advertisements is very easy, as you simply need to block these file types from being downloaded/opened:

```diff
.1ad_v
.1ad_a
.1ad_t
.1ad_g
.1ad_i
.1ad_f
```

Any attempt to tamper with this process in order to make it harder for adblockers is non-compliant behavior.
